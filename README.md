# discord-server-crasher
Crash discord servers with the new 'Gift Premium' addon in discord.

This works as of 12/21/2018, crashes every member in the discord that is looking at the chat when the command !crash is typed in chat.
I'm not responsible for anything that happens, i made this for fun only.
I've also reported this to discord, so this should be fixed soon.

Usage:
 - Install python 3.6, and don't forget to select 'Add to path', when launching the installer.
 - Put your token in the token field in the code (line 15).
 - Open a command prompt and type 'pip install discord' & 'pip install string' & 'pip install random' & 'pip install time'
 - Open a command prompt and type 'python run.py' 
 - To crash a server type '!crash!' in the server.
